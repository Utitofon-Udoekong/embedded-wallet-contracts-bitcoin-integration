# Bitcoin Integration Enhancement

## Overview
Added Bitcoin private key generation and transaction signing capabilities to the smart contract system, enabling secure management of Bitcoin private keys and transaction signing using the secp256k1 curve.

## New Features

### 1. Bitcoin Key Generation and Management
- Implemented secure Bitcoin private key generation using secp256k1 curve parameters
- Added public key derivation in both compressed (33 bytes) and uncompressed (65 bytes) formats
- Implemented Bitcoin address generation with version byte and checksum
- Added comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Multiple entropy sources for secure key generation

### 2. SECP256K1 Implementation
- Complete implementation of secp256k1 curve operations
- Point addition and multiplication
- Modular arithmetic operations
- Curve parameter validation
- Point-on-curve validation

### 3. Bitcoin Transaction Signing
- Implemented transaction hash signing with RFC6979 placeholder
- Added support for Bitcoin's low-s value requirement
- Included recovery ID (v) in signature output
- Comprehensive signature validation
- Secure nonce generation (placeholder for RFC6979)
