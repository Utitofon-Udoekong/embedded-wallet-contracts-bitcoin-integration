# Bitcoin Integration Enhancement

## Overview
Added Bitcoin private key generation and transaction signing capabilities to the smart contract system, enabling secure management of Bitcoin private keys and transaction signing within the secure enclave.

## New Features

### 1. Bitcoin Key Generation
- Implemented secure Bitcoin private key generation using secp256k1
- Added public key derivation (both compressed and uncompressed formats)
- Generated Bitcoin addresses from public keys
- Integrated with existing key management system
- Added salt parameter for additional security

### 2. Bitcoin Transaction Signing
- Added transaction hash signing functionality
- Implemented Bitcoin signature format support with sighash types
- Added security measures for private key handling
- Implemented validation checks for private keys and signatures

## Technical Details

### Bitcoin.sol Library
- Core Bitcoin cryptographic operations
- Integration with existing SECP256K1 library
- Key pair generation and management
- Transaction signing logic
- Public key compression
- Address generation (simplified version - needs RIPEMD160)

### Security Features
- Private key validation
- Entropy + salt combination for key generation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Secure key storage within contract

## Security Considerations
- Private keys never leave the contract
- All operations are performed within the secure enclave
- Multiple entropy sources for key generation
- Implemented key derivation security measures
- Input validation for all operations

## Testing
Added comprehensive test suite:
- Key generation tests
  - Valid key pair generation
  - Entropy uniqueness tests
  - Key format validation
- Transaction signing tests
  - Signature validation
  - SigHash type handling
- Integration tests with wallet system
- Security test cases
  - Invalid input handling
  - Error conditions

## Future Improvements
1. Implement full Bitcoin address generation with RIPEMD160
2. Add support for different address formats (P2PKH, P2SH, etc.)
3. Implement full transaction serialization
4. Add support for different signature hash types
5. Implement BIP32/BIP44 key derivation
